				<p> Welcome to a HTML5 canvas game developed for my final year project. The game is a classic wave clearing zombie game, where you either alone or with others have to defend yourself as long as possible against the swarming zombies hordes!

				<br/><br/>You have decided to try and defend yourself from the safety of your own home, but the zombies are busting through your windows, use your weapon to see they are thwarted.
				
				<br/><br/> If you're new, the tutorials page is highly recommended, once complete feel free to practise<br/>the game on your own, but if you're feeling lucky, jump right into the multiplayer action!
